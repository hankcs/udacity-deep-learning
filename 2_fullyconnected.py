# Assignment 2
# ------------
# 
# Previously in `1_notmnist.ipynb`, we created a pickle with formatted datasets for training, development and testing on the [notMNIST dataset](http://yaroslavvb.blogspot.com/2011/09/notmnist-dataset.html).
#
# The goal of this assignment is to progressively train deeper and more accurate models using TensorFlow.

# In[ ]:

# These are all the modules we'll be using later. Make sure you can import them
# before proceeding further.

# We're first going to train a multinomial logistic regression using simple gradient descent.
#
# TensorFlow works like this:
# * First you describe the computation that you want to see performed: what the inputs, the variables, and the operations look like. These get created as nodes over a computation graph. This description is all contained within the block below:
#
#       with graph.as_default():
#           ...
#
# * Then you can run the operations on this graph as many times as you want by calling `session.run()`, providing it outputs to fetch from the graph that get returned. This runtime operation is all contained in the block below:
#
#       with tf.Session(graph=graph) as session:
#           ...
#
# Let's load all the data into TensorFlow and build the computation graph corresponding to our training:

# In[ ]:

# With gradient descent training, even this much data is prohibitive.
# Subset the training data for faster turnaround.

        tf.truncated_normal([image_size * image_size, num_labels]))
    biases = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([num_labels]))

    # Training computation.
    # We multiply the inputs with the weight matrix, and add biases. We compute
    # the softmax and cross-entropy (it's one operation in TensorFlow, because
    # it's very common, and it can be optimized). We take the average of this
    # cross-entropy across all training examples: that's our loss.
